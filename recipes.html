                  <article>
                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                      <li>1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                      <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                      <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                      <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                      <li>2 large eggs</li>
                      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
                      <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
                      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                      <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two
                        9-inch round baking pans.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa
                        powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, oil, and
                        vanilla extract until well combined.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry
                        ingredients, mixing until just combined.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but
                        that's okay.
                      </li>
                      <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
                      <li>
                        Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted
                        into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Remove from the oven and allow the cakes to cool in the
                        pans for 10 minutes.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool completely
                        before frosting.
                      </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Frosting:</h4>
                    <p>
                      You can use your favorite frosting recipe or store-bought
                      frosting to decorate the cake. Common choices include
                      chocolate buttercream or cream cheese frosting.

                    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>3 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                      <li>
                        1 packet active dry yeast (about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons)
                      </li>
                      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                      <li>1 and 1/4 cups warm water (110°F-115°F)</li>
                      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water.
                        Sprinkle the yeast over the top, stir gently, and let it
                        sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make
                        a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and
                        olive oil.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Mix the ingredients together until a dough forms. If the
                        dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for
                        about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to
                        coat. Cover with a clean towel and let it rise in a warm
                        place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Punch down the dough
                        to release any air bubbles, then shape it into a loaf.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Place the loaf in a greased 9x5-inch loaf pan. Cover and
                        let it rise again for about 30 minutes.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes,
                        or until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds
                        hollow when tapped.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the
                        pan for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool
                        completely before slicing.
                      </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Serving Suggestions:</h4>
                    <p>
                      Homemade bread is perfect for sandwiches, toast, or simply
                      enjoying with a spread of butter. You can also add
                      toppings like seeds or herbs to the dough before baking
                      for extra flavor.
